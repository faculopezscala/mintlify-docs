<Note>
  This guide assumes you have already [installed Bugster CLI](/installation). If not, please install it first.
</Note>

## Quick Setup

Get up and running with Bugster CLI in just a few commands. This guide will walk you through creating your first automated test suite.

### 1. Authenticate with Bugster

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Set up your API key">
    First, you need to connect your CLI to your Bugster account:
    
    ```bash
    bugster auth
    ```
    
    You'll be prompted to enter your Bugster API key. You can find this in your [Bugster dashboard](https://dashboard.bugster.dev) under Account Settings.
    
    <Tip>
      Don't have a Bugster account yet? [Sign up here](https://bugster.dev/signup) to get started.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Initialize Your Project

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Set up project configuration">
    Navigate to your project directory and initialize Bugster:
    
    ```bash
    cd your-project-directory
    bugster init
    ```
    
    This will:
    - Create a `.bugster` directory in your project
    - Set up configuration files
    - Prepare your project for test generation
    
    <Info>
      The init command will prompt you for your application's base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Generate Your First Tests

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="magnifying-glass" title="Analyze your codebase">
    Let Bugster analyze your code and automatically generate test specifications:
    
    ```bash
    bugster generate
    ```
    
    This intelligent analysis will:
    - Scan your codebase to understand its structure
    - Identify key user flows and features
    - Generate comprehensive test specifications
    - Save tests in the `.bugster/tests` directory
    
    <Tip>
      Use `bugster generate --show-logs` to see detailed information about what Bugster is discovering in your code.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 4. Run Your Tests

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="play" title="Execute your automated tests">
    Now run the generated tests:
    
    ```bash
    bugster run
    ```
    
    For your first run, you might want to see the browser in action:
    ```bash
    bugster run --stream-results
    ```
    
    <Note>
      Make sure your application is running on the base URL you specified during init (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
    </Note>

## Common First-Time Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="desktop" title="Testing a Local Development Server">
    If you're testing a local development server:
    
    ```bash
    # Start your development server first
    npm run dev  # or your equivalent command
    
    # In another terminal, run tests
    bugster run --base-url http://localhost:3000
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="cloud" title="Testing a Staging Environment">
    To test against a staging or production environment:
    
    ```bash
    bugster run --base-url https://staging.yourapp.com
    ```
    
    You can also update your base configuration:
    ```bash
    # Re-run init to update the base URL
    bugster init
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="bug" title="Debugging Test Failures">
    If tests fail on first run:
    
    ```bash
    # Run with detailed output
    bugster run --show-logs --stream-results
    
    # Run without headless mode to see what's happening
    bugster run
    
    # Test a specific file
    bugster run .bugster/tests/specific_test.yml
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="refresh" title="Updating Tests After Code Changes">
    When you make changes to your application:
    
    ```bash
    # Update existing tests to match code changes
    bugster update
    
    # Run tests to verify they still pass
    bugster run
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example Workflow

Here's a typical development workflow with Bugster CLI:

```bash
# 1. Start with authentication (one-time setup)
bugster auth

# 2. Initialize new project (one-time per project)
bugster init

# 3. Generate initial test suite
bugster generate

# 4. Run tests to establish baseline
bugster run

# 5. Make code changes
# ... your development work ...

# 6. Update tests for new changes
bugster update

# 7. Run updated tests
bugster run

# 8. Share with team (if using team features)
bugster sync
```

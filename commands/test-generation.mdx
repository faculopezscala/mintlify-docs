description: 'Generate AI-powered tests from your codebase with bugster generate'
---

<Note>
  Ensure you have [set up your project](/commands/project-setup) before generating tests.
</Note>

## Overview

The `bugster generate` command analyzes your codebase using AI to automatically create comprehensive test specifications. It understands your application structure and generates relevant tests covering key user flows and functionality.

## Command Usage

### `bugster generate`

<Card title="Generate Tests from Codebase" icon="magic">
  Analyze your codebase to automatically generate comprehensive test specifications using AI.
</Card>

```bash
bugster generate [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--show-logs` - Show detailed logs during the analysis process
- `--force, -f` - Force analysis even if codebase has already been analyzed (overrides cache)

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Codebase Scanning">
    Bugster scans your project files to understand the application structure, routes, components, and functionality.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AI Analysis">
    Advanced AI models analyze the code patterns to identify testable user flows, critical paths, and edge cases.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Specification Creation">
    Generates comprehensive test specifications in YAML format that describe user interactions and expected outcomes.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="File Organization">
    Saves the generated tests in the `.bugster/tests` directory with logical grouping and naming.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Basic Usage

### Generate Tests
```bash
# Basic test generation
bugster generate
```

### Generate with Detailed Logging
```bash
# See what Bugster is analyzing
bugster generate --show-logs
```

### Force Regeneration
```bash
# Force fresh analysis (bypasses cache)
bugster generate --force
```

## Generated Test Structure

Tests are created in YAML format with this structure:

```yaml
- name: User Registration Flow
  task: Verify that new users can successfully create an account
  expected_result: User should be registered and logged in
  steps:
    - Navigate to /signup page
    - Fill in email field with "test@example.com"
    - Fill in password field with "securePassword123"
    - Fill in confirm password field with "securePassword123"
    - Click "Create Account" button
    - Verify welcome message is displayed
    - Verify user is redirected to dashboard
```

## Test Organization

Generated tests are organized in the `.bugster/tests` directory:

```
.bugster/tests/
├── smoke_tests/          # Critical path tests
│   ├── login.yml
│   └── core_features.yml
├── integration/          # Feature integration tests
│   ├── user_management.yml
│   └── payment_flow.yml
├── e2e/                 # End-to-end scenarios
│   ├── complete_user_journey.yml
│   └── admin_workflows.yml
└── edge_cases/          # Error and boundary tests
    ├── validation_errors.yml
    └── permission_tests.yml
```

## Customizing Generation

### Project Types
Bugster automatically detects and optimizes for different project types:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="E-commerce" icon="shopping-cart">
    Focuses on product browsing, cart management, checkout flows, and payment processing.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="SaaS Applications" icon="building">
    Emphasizes user onboarding, feature usage, subscription management, and admin functions.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Content Platforms" icon="newspaper">
    Targets content creation, publishing workflows, search, and user engagement features.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Admin Dashboards" icon="chart-bar">
    Concentrates on data management, reporting, user administration, and configuration features.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Framework Detection
Bugster recognizes and adapts to various frameworks:

- **React/Vue/Angular**: Component-based testing
- **Node.js/Express**: API endpoint testing
- **Rails/Django**: MVC pattern testing
- **WordPress**: CMS-specific flows

## Advanced Options

### Selective Generation
```bash
# Generate tests for specific directories
bugster generate --path src/components/auth

# Focus on specific file types
bugster generate --include "*.jsx,*.vue"

# Exclude certain directories
bugster generate --exclude node_modules,dist
```

### Generation Modes
```bash
# Conservative mode (fewer, high-confidence tests)
bugster generate --mode conservative

# Comprehensive mode (more extensive coverage)
bugster generate --mode comprehensive

# Custom coverage target
bugster generate --coverage 80
```

## Quality and Coverage

<Card title="AI Quality Assurance" icon="robot">

</Card>

**What Bugster Analyzes:**
- Component relationships and data flow
- User interface patterns and interactions
- Business logic and validation rules
- Error handling and edge cases
- Security and permission boundaries

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Generation Taking Too Long">
    **Causes:**
    - Very large codebase
    - Complex dependency graphs
    - Network connectivity issues
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Use `--path` to analyze specific directories
    - Exclude large dependencies with `--exclude`
    - Check internet connection for AI processing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="file-x" title="No Tests Generated">
    **Causes:**
    - No recognizable UI components found
    - Unsupported framework or structure
    - Configuration issues
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Ensure you're in the correct project directory
    - Check that your project has frontend components
    - Run with `--show-logs` to see analysis details
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="exclamation-triangle" title="Low Quality Tests">
    **Causes:**
    - Unusual code patterns
    - Missing documentation or comments
    - Complex custom frameworks
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Add comments to critical code sections
    - Use `--mode comprehensive` for deeper analysis
    - Manually review and edit generated tests
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Card title="Code Preparation" icon="code">
  **Clean codebase:** Well-organized, commented code leads to better test generation. Consider adding JSDoc or similar documentation before generating tests.
</Card>

<Card title="Iterative Approach" icon="refresh">
  **Start small:** Begin with core features, run tests, then expand. Use `--path` to focus on specific areas initially.
</Card>

<Card title="Review Generated Tests" icon="eye">
  **Quality check:** Always review generated tests before running them in production. AI-generated tests are highly accurate but may need minor adjustments.
</Card>

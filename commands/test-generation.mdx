description: 'Generate AI-powered tests from your codebase with bugster generate'
---

<Note>
  Ensure you have [set up your project](/commands/project-setup) before generating tests.
</Note>

## Command Usage

### `bugster generate`

Analyze your codebase to automatically create comprehensive test specifications using AI.

```bash
bugster generate [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--show-logs` - Show detailed logs during the analysis process
- `--force, -f` - Force analysis even if codebase has already been analyzed (overrides cache)

## Examples

```bash
# Basic test generation
bugster generate

# Generate with detailed logging
bugster generate --show-logs

# Force re-analysis of already analyzed codebase
bugster generate --force
```

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Codebase Scanning">
    Bugster scans your project files to understand the application structure.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AI Analysis">
    AI models analyze the code patterns to identify testable user flows and functionality.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Creation">
    Generates comprehensive test specifications in YAML format.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="File Organization">
    Saves the generated tests in the `.bugster/tests` directory.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Generated Test Example

```yaml
- name: User Registration Flow
  task: Verify that new users can successfully create an account
  expected_result: User should be registered and logged in
  steps:
    - Navigate to /signup page
    - Fill in email field with "test@example.com"
    - Fill in password field with "securePassword123"
    - Click "Create Account" button
    - Verify welcome message is displayed
    - Verify user is redirected to dashboard
```

## Test Organization

Generated tests are organized in the `.bugster/tests` directory:

```
.bugster/tests/
├── smoke_tests/          # Critical path tests
├── integration/          # Feature integration tests
├── e2e/                 # End-to-end scenarios
└── edge_cases/          # Error and boundary tests
```

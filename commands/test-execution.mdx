<Note>
  Make sure you have [generated tests](/commands/test-generation) before attempting to run them.
</Note>

## Command Usage

### `bugster run`

Execute your automated tests with various execution modes and output options.

```bash
bugster run [PATH] [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**
- `PATH` - Optional path to test file or directory (defaults to `.bugster/tests`)

**Options:**
- `--headless` - Run tests in headless mode
- `--silent, -s` - Run in silent mode with less verbose output
- `--stream-results` - Stream test results as they complete
- `--base-url URL` - Override the base URL for the test run
- `--output FILE` - Save test results to a JSON file
- `--run-id ID` - Associate a specific run ID with the test execution

## Examples

```bash
# Run all tests
bugster run

# Run specific test
bugster run .bugster/tests/login.yml

# Run directory
bugster run .bugster/tests/smoke_tests/

# Headless execution
bugster run --headless

# Stream results with output
bugster run --stream-results --output results.json

# Different environment
bugster run --base-url https://staging.example.com

# With custom run ID
bugster run --run-id "release-v1.2.3"
```

## Understanding Results

### Console Output
```bash
✅ User Login Flow                    (2.3s)
✅ Product Search                     (1.8s)
❌ Checkout Process                   (4.1s) - Payment form validation failed
✅ User Profile Update                (1.5s)

Summary: 3 passed, 1 failed (9.7s total)
```

### JSON Output (when using --output)
```json
{
  "run_id": "test-run-123",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "total_tests": 4,
  "passed": 3,
  "failed": 1,
  "duration": 9700
}
```

## Common Issues

**Tests fail on first run:**
- Check your application is running at the base URL
- Verify authentication credentials in config

**Tests taking too long:**
- Use `--headless` for faster execution
- Check if your application is responding slowly

**Browser issues:**
- Make sure browser dependencies are installed
- Try running without `--headless` to see what's happening

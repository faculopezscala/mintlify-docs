Once installed, you can use Bugster CLI by running:

```bash
bugster --help
```

This command will display all available top-level commands, global options, and a list of subcommands

<Tip>You can also get help for specific subcommands (e.g., `bugster test --help`) to see options for that particular command. E.g., `bugster test --help`.</Tip>

## Commands Overview

The Bugster CLI provides commands to initialize your configuration and run tests. Here are the main commands:

### `bugster init`

<Card title="Initialize Bugster Configuration" icon="gear">
  This command initializes the Bugster CLI configuration, setting up the necessary files and settings for you to start using Bugster.
</Card>

Run the command:
```bash
bugster init
```

**Key Actions:**

*   Prompts for a "Base URL" (defaulting to `http://localhost:3000`).
*   Asks if you want to add credentials (e.g., username and password) and guides you through the process. If no credentials are added, it sets up default admin credentials.
*   Creates a `.bugster` directory in your current project.
*   Saves your configuration (Base URL, credentials) into a `config.yml` file within the `.bugster` directory.
*   Creates an example test file (e.g., `example_test.yml`) in a `.bugster/examples` directory to help you get started.
*   Displays the location of the created configuration and example test files, along with a table of the configured credentials.

### `bugster analyze`

<Card title="Analyze Your Codebase" icon="magnifying-glass">
  This command lets Bugster agent analyze your codebase, understand it, and create a suite of tests based on the analysis.
</Card>

Run the command:
```bash
bugster analyze
```

**Key Actions:**

*   Scans your codebase to understand its structure and functionality
*   Creates a suite of tests (currently 5 tests in v0) based on the analysis
*   The tests are created in Bugster format (YAML) which the agent uses to perform flows and validate results

**Example test file created:**

```yaml
- name: Checkout Process Test
  task: Verify that users can complete the checkout process
  expected_result: Order should be successfully placed
  steps:
    - Navigate to /products page
    - Add a product to the cart
    - Navigate to /cart page
    - Verify product is in the cart
    - Click "Proceed to Checkout" button
    - Fill in shipping information
    - Select shipping method
    - Enter payment information
    - Review order summary
    - Click "Place Order" button
    - Verify order confirmation page is displayed
```

### `bugster test`

<Card title="Run Bugster Tests" icon="terminal">
  This command is used to run your Bugster tests.
</Card>

Run the command (example with a specific test path):
```bash
bugster test your_test_file.yml
```

**Arguments/Options:**

*   **`test_path`** (optional): Specify a particular test file or a directory containing test files. If not provided, it may look for tests in a default location (e.g., `.bugster/examples`).
    *   Example: `bugster test tests/smoke_tests/`
*   **`--headless`** (optional flag): Runs browser tests without opening a visible browser window.
    *   Example: `bugster test --headless`
*   **`--silent`** (optional flag): Suppresses some of the detailed output logging to the console.
    *   Example: `bugster test --silent`

**Key Actions During Execution:**

*   Loads the configuration previously set up using the `init` command.
*   Finds and loads your test files (typically YAML or JSON).
*   For each test case:
    *   The Bugster Agent opens a browser and performs the test exactly as described in the test file
    *   The agent executes each step in the test file in sequence
    *   The agent validates the results based on the expected outcomes
    *   Upon completion, the agent determines if the test passed or failed
*   After all tests are run, displays a summary table of the results (Test Name, Result, Reason, Time taken) and the total time taken.
*   If any test fails, the command exits with an error code.

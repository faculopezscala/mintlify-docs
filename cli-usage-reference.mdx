Once installed, you can use Bugster CLI by running:

```bash
bugster --help
```

This command will display all available top-level commands, global options, and a list of subcommands

<Tip>You can also get help for specific subcommands (e.g., `bugster test --help`) to see options for that particular command. E.g., `bugster test --help`.</Tip>

## Commands Overview

The Bugster CLI provides commands to initialize your configuration and run tests. Here are the main commands:

### `bugster init`

<Card title="Initialize Bugster Configuration" icon="gear">
  This command initializes the Bugster CLI configuration, setting up the necessary files and settings for you to start using Bugster.
</Card>

Run the command:
```bash
bugster init
```

**Key Actions:**

*   Prompts for a "Base URL" (defaulting to `http://localhost:3000`).
*   Asks if you want to add credentials (e.g., username and password) and guides you through the process. If no credentials are added, it sets up default admin credentials.
*   Creates a `.bugster` directory in your current project.
*   Saves your configuration (Base URL, credentials) into a `config.yml` file within the `.bugster` directory.
*   Creates an example test file (e.g., `example_test.yml`) in a `.bugster/examples` directory to help you get started.
*   Displays the location of the created configuration and example test files, along with a table of the configured credentials.

### `bugster analyze`

<Card title="Analyze Your Codebase" icon="magnifying-glass">
  This command analyzes your codebase for potential issues and provides recommendations.
</Card>

Run the command:
```bash
bugster analyze
```

**Key Actions:**

*   Scans your app and creates a basic test suite from the analysis.

### `bugster test`

<Card title="Run Bugster Tests" icon="terminal">
  This command is used to run your Bugster tests.
</Card>

Run the command (example with a specific test path):
```bash
bugster test your_test_file.yml
```

**Arguments/Options:**

*   **`test_path`** (optional): Specify a particular test file or a directory containing test files. If not provided, it may look for tests in a default location (e.g., `.bugster/examples`).
    *   Example: `bugster test tests/smoke_tests/`
*   **`--headless`** (optional flag): Runs browser tests without opening a visible browser window.
    *   Example: `bugster test --headless`
*   **`--silent`** (optional flag): Suppresses some of the detailed output logging to the console.
    *   Example: `bugster test --silent`

**Key Actions During Execution:**

*   Loads the configuration previously set up using the `init` command.
*   Finds and loads your test files (typically YAML or JSON).
*   For each test case:
    *   Establishes a WebSocket connection with a "Bugster Agent" (a running Bugster server/service).
    *   Initializes an "MCP (Multi-Capability Playwright) client," using Playwright for browser automation.
    *   Sends the test definition and configuration to the Bugster Agent.
    *   Receives and executes instructions (e.g., "click a button", "fill a form field") from the Agent via the Playwright MCP client.
    *   Sends the result of each step back to the Agent.
    *   Upon completion, receives the final test result (pass/fail) and reason from the Agent.
*   After all tests are run, displays a summary table of the results (Test Name, Result, Reason, Time taken) and the total time taken.
*   If any test fails, the command exits with an error code.

Bugster CLI is an autonomous QA agent that opens your app in the browser, like a user would, and tells you what's broken. Instead of writing tests, Bugster analyzes your codebase and simulates real user interactions to catch bugs before your users do.

## How Developers Ship with Confidence

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Autonomous Bug Detection" icon="bug">
    Bugster doesn't test your code — it tests your app. It opens your product in real browsers and uses it like an actual user to find what's broken.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Real User Simulation" icon="user">
    No test writing required. Bugster understands your app flows and simulates real user interactions to catch bugs you didn't think to test for.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Zero Maintenance QA" icon="shield">
    Bugster adapts as your app evolves. When you ship new features, it automatically understands the changes and finds new ways things can break.

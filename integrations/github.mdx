Bugster integrates with GitHub to automatically run tests when deployments are created, providing immediate feedback on your application's functionality.

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install GitHub App">
    Go to the overview section in [gui.bugster.dev](https://gui.bugster.dev) and click on "manage connections" in the GitHub app section. On GitHub, authenticate for the specific repository you want Bugster to work with.
    
    <Warning>
      You must grant access to specific repositories only. Granting access to all repositories won't work with Bugster.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Initialize Bugster">
    Your repository must have a `.bugster` folder in the root directory:
    ```bash
    bugster init
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Vercel Setup (if applicable)">
    If using Vercel previews, disable preview protection to allow Bugster access.
    
    <Note>
      We're working on implementing bypass protection features to avoid this requirement.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

Bugster automatically runs tests when GitHub receives a `deployment_status` event. This happens with:

- **Vercel deployments** - Tests run when preview deployments are ready
- **GitHub Actions with environments** - Tests run when using GitHub environments
- **Any platform** that triggers GitHub deployment events

<Warning>
  Tests run on **any deployment**, not just pull requests. If there's an open PR for that deployment, results will be posted as comments.
</Warning>

## Vercel Integration

When you push to any branch:

1. Vercel creates a preview deployment
2. GitHub receives the deployment event
3. Bugster automatically runs tests against the preview URL
4. If there's an open PR, results are posted as comments

```bash
# This will trigger tests automatically
git push origin feature/new-dashboard
```

## GitHub Actions Integration

Use GitHub environments in your deployment workflow:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: Production
      url: https://your-app.com  # Tests run against this URL
    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        run: echo "Deploying to Production"
```

**Key points:**
- The `environment` section is required
- Tests run against the `url` specified in the environment
- If no URL is provided, tests use the `base_url` from `.bugster/config.yaml`

## Configuration

Ensure your `.bugster/config.yaml` has the correct base URL as fallback:

```yaml
base_url: "https://your-app.com"
```

## Supported Platforms

Any deployment platform that triggers GitHub's `deployment_status` event:

- ✅ Vercel
- ✅ GitHub Actions with environments
- ✅ Most major deployment platforms

<Tip>
  Most deployment platforms support GitHub deployment events, but we've specifically tested with Vercel and GitHub Actions.
</Tip>

## Test Results

Results appear as:
- Comments on pull requests (when applicable)
- Status checks on commits
- Detailed reports in your Bugster dashboard

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Tests not running">
    **Check:**
    - GitHub App is installed and has repository access
    - `.bugster` folder exists in repository root
    - Deployment actually completed (check GitHub deployments tab)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Vercel preview access issues">
    **Solution:**
    - Disable preview protection in Vercel settings
    - Or wait for our bypass protection feature (coming soon)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="settings" title="Missing environment URL">
    **Result:**
    Tests will run against the `base_url` in your `.bugster/config.yaml` instead of the deployment URL.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

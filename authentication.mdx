<Note>
  Authentication is handled during project initialization. It is the **first step** you must complete before using any other Bugster CLI features.
</Note>

## How to Authenticate

To authenticate the Bugster CLI, you need to run the `init` command. This command will guide you through setting up your project and connecting to your Bugster account.

```bash
bugster init
```

During the initialization process, you will be prompted to enter your Bugster API key.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the init command">
    Open your terminal and run `bugster init`.
    ```bash
    bugster init
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get your API key">
    You can find your API key in your [Bugster dashboard](https://gui.bugster.dev) under the Account Settings section.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter your API key">
    Paste your API key when prompted by the CLI and press Enter. The CLI will validate the key and store it securely for future use.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

**Invalid API Key:**
- If you enter an invalid key, the `init` command will report an error. Double-check your API key in the Bugster dashboard and try running `bugster init` again.
- Make sure you are copying the entire key without any extra spaces.

**Network Issues:**
- The CLI needs to connect to Bugster servers to validate the API key. Ensure you have an active internet connection.

## Next Steps
